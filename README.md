Express Tanks is a web app built on the Express Node.js web application framework.  It uses node.js and socket.io to communicate between the Client and Server.  The application allows multiple clients to connect to the server and play a simple tank battle game.  Graphics and some functionality (such as key listeners) are handled by p5.js.
